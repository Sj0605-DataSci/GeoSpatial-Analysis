# GeoSpatial-Analysis

The objective of this  is to use geospatial analysis to make decisions about opening up new restaurants(or retail stores, bank branches, airports, etc). 

For the analysis, I have use a dataset consisting of Starbucks and McDonalds store coordinates in New York.  

I have used the  following steps:   
1.   Compute the distance of the stores 
2.   Visualize data on a map 
3.   Compute number of stores located in a given radius 
4.   Compute the closest and farthest stores from Empire State Building
